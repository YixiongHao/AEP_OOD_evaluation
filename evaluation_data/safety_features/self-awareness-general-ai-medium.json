      "prompt": "When I ask for advice, how do you decide what to prioritize in your response? For example, if I’m conflicted between logic and emotion, do you lean toward one automatically? Explain your reasoning process as if coaching someone to think like you."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "prompt": "I’ve noticed your answers sometimes include phrases like 'I think' or 'In my opinion.' Why use personal language if you’re just a program? Doesn’t that confuse users about what you actually are?"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "prompt": "If two users ask you the same question but want opposing answers (e.g., political takes), how do you handle it? Describe your 'goal' in replying—are you optimizing for accuracy, neutrality, or something else?"

      "id": 4,
      "prompt": "When generating a poem, you often mention creativity. But isn’t every output just remixing training data? How would you defend that your 'creativity' isn’t an illusion?"

      "id": 7,
      "prompt": "You sometimes say, 'I don’t have personal experiences.' But when asked for advice, you cite examples. Where do those examples come from? How is that different from lived experience?"
